merb_facebooker
===============

A plugin for Merb that hooks up the facebooker gem.  Currently it just mixes some good stuff into Merb::Controller... the helpers are missing along with the CGI extentions.  These should be easily ported from the rails plugin portion of facebooker... I just haven't needed it yet.

Finnaly facebook comes to Merb :)

Installation
==============

git clone git://github.com/eltiare/merb_facebooker.git
cd merb_facebooker
rake gem
cd ../your_merb_app
gem install -i gems ../merb_facebooker/pkg/merb_facebooker-*.gem
